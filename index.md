		<h2>Maze Robot Simulator</h2>
		<img src="images/maze_robot_sim.gif?raw=true"/>
		<br>
		<p>
		A maze robot simulator built for the Queen's Robotics Society to help with the NI Robotics League maze competition. 
		I noticed the maze to be used in the competition only had 20 moveable gates (which could be in 1 of 2 positions). 
		The rest of the maze was fixed. This gave a total of 2<sup>20</sup> (1048576) different configurations. 
		With the simulator we could find the best algorithms to solve the maze.

		<h2>Data Analysis of House Values in NI</h2>
		<img src="images/NI_properties.png?raw=true"/>
		<br>
		<p>
		Exploring Northern domestic property value using Land and Property Services NI data and other publically available datasets.
		I started this as a university project but it was interesting to explore the data and find hidden patterns. There is lots of
		potential to explore it further. I am still writing tidying up this project so currently there is only the initial data preparation
		and light exploration. More to come soon.

		<p>
		A maze robot simulator built for the Queen's Robotics Society to help with the NI Robotics League maze competition. 
		I noticed the maze to be used in the competition only had 20 moveable gates (which could be in 1 of 2 positions). 
		The rest of the maze was fixed. This gave a total of 2<sup>20</sup> (1048576) different configurations. 
		With the simulator we could find the best algorithms to solve the maze.
